v2.1.1
======

v2.1.1 is a small bugfix to resolve an issue with the file manager when editing JSON files, and adding support for SMTP email. Do note that a lot of emails are not built-in yet, but you should be able to now configure any email provider. This also adds arm64 as a pre-built binary.

Changelog
^^^^^^^^^
- Fix issue in File Manager where JSON files were being saved as [object Object] instead of the actual contents
- Add SMTP email support with following options:

.. code-block:: JSON

  {
    "panel": {
      "email": {
        "from": "noreply@example.com",
        "host": "mysmtp.example.com:587",
        "username": "postmaster",
        "password": "mypassword"
      }
    }
  }
