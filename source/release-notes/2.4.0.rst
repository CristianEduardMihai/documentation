Windows Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now have an official Windows installer which will install a PufferPanel service to Windows. This installer is supported on Windows Server 2012+.
As a warning, we DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THE LOCAL SERVICE ACOUNT. You will want to create a PufferPanel user on your server and use this to run the service.
Due to the complexity of installers, we do not do this automatically. This allows for a compromised server to have less rights than Local Service would otherwise
give.
